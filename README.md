# bblog-true-players-bf3
A very simple Better Battlelog plugin for Battlefield 3 which shows the real players count for a server.

# How to Install
1. Have Better Battlelog browser plugin installed and active (you can find it here: https://getbblog.com);
2. Go to Battlefield 3 Battlelog webpage (https://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3);
3. On the left you should see a "Better Battlelog" sidebutton:

4. Hover over it or click on it, it should open Better Battlelog sidebar with all the options:

6. In this window you can either copy and paste direct links to plugins or copy and paste an entire plugin code and modify it on the fly.
   - For easy installation just copy this link: https://dendari92.github.io/bblog-true-players-bf3/bblog-true-players-bf3.js in the first text field (just above the "Plugin Editor" label) and press enter. Reload the webpage to apply the changes.

   - If you want to see the code and play around with it you can copy and paste the code in the big textarea at the bottom of the pop-up window. You can find the plugin code here: https://github.com/Dendari92/bblog-true-players-bf3/blob/main/bblog-true-players-bf3.js

# Known Issues and Limitations
Currently the biggest limitation is that sorting by real players count isn't possible, so you might see empty servers at the top when sorting by players.

The way the plugin shows real players it's kinda ugly, just wanted something (mostly) functional.
